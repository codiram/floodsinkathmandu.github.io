    <h1>Climate Change, The Scapegoat of Unplanned Urbanization?</h1>
    <header>
        <p>Kathmandu Valley has faced increasingly frequent flash floods with dangers heightened by climate change and rapid urbanization<sup><a href="https://risingnepaldaily.com/news/30780">(2)</a></sup> and unplanned urban encroachment around the Bagmati River<sup><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/2/what-caused-the-devastating-floods-in-nepal">(4)</a></sup>.
        The floods were well forecasted by the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, but it's unclear to what extent the warning led to early action<sup><a href="https://www.preventionweb.net/news/rapid-urbanisation-and-climate-change-key-drivers-dramatic-flood-impacts-nepal">(3)</a></sup>.
        The extreme heavy rainfall, which was the highest recorded in 54 years<sup><a href="https://www.dhm.gov.np/downloads">(5)</a></sup>, caused landslides, flash floods, and riverine flooding from the Bagmati, Sapotakoshi, Narayani, Sardu, Rew, and Nakkhu rivers and their tributaries.
        244 people were killed in this event<sup><a href="https://risingnepaldaily.com/news/30780">(2)</a></sup>.
        Kathmandu Valley's unique geography makes it susceptible to flooding<sup><a href="https://nepalitimes.com/banner/kathmandus-flash-floods-are-4-decades-in-the-making">(1)</a></sup>.</p>

        <p>Situated in a valley with few natural drainage points, the region has historically experienced periodic floods, especially during the monsoon season<sup><a href="https://nepalitimes.com/banner/kathmandus-flash-floods-are-4-decades-in-the-making">(1)</a><a href="https://risingnepaldaily.com/news/30780">(2)</a></sup>.
        These floods were once beneficial, bringing soil-restoring silt to farms<sup><a href="https://nepalitimes.com/banner/kathmandus-flash-floods-are-4-decades-in-the-making">(1)</a></sup>. However, in recent decades, these floods have become more destructive, often referred to as flash floods due to the rapid rise of river levels<sup><a href="https://nepalitimes.com/banner/kathmandus-flash-floods-are-4-decades-in-the-making">(1)</a><a href="https://risingnepaldaily.com/news/30780">(2)</a></sup>.</p>

        <p>Unplanned urbanization is a major culprit in this; Kathmandu quadrupled in settlement between 1980 and 2010 and continues to expand rapidly<sup><a href="https://nepalitimes.com/banner/kathmandus-flash-floods-are-4-decades-in-the-making">(1)</a></sup>.
        This urban sprawl has come at the expense of the valley's natural drainage system and hydrological integrity<sup><a href="https://nepalitimes.com/banner/kathmandus-flash-floods-are-4-decades-in-the-making">(1)</a></sup>.</p>

            <h3>Loss of Open Spaces and Wetlands</h3>
            <p>The conversion of open spaces and wetlands into concrete surfaces has significantly reduced the land's capacity to absorb rainwater<sup><a href="https://nepalitimes.com/banner/kathmandus-flash-floods-are-4-decades-in-the-making">(1)</a></sup>, resulting in increased surface runoff and faster, more intense flooding<sup><a href="https://nepalitimes.com/banner/kathmandus-flash-floods-are-4-decades-in-the-making">(1)</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Destruction of Sand Hillocks</h3>
            <p>Widespread bulldozing of sand hillocks, known as dido in Nepali, has removed a crucial natural water storage system<sup><a href="https://nepalitimes.com/banner/kathmandus-flash-floods-are-4-decades-in-the-making">(1)</a></sup>.
            These hillocks used to store rainwater and release it slowly, mitigating flood peaks<sup><a href="https://nepalitimes.com/banner/kathmandus-flash-floods-are-4-decades-in-the-making">(1)</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Encroachment on Floodplains</h3>
            <p>Buildings, including homes, began appearing on the valley's floodplains in the 1970s<sup><a href="https://nepalitimes.com/banner/kathmandus-flash-floods-are-4-decades-in-the-making">(1)</a></sup>. A 1986 report by the Government of Nepal & USAID warned against this practice, predicting severe problems due to the inherent flood risk in these areas<sup><a href="https://nepalitimes.com/banner/kathmandus-flash-floods-are-4-decades-in-the-making">(1)</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Altered Riverbeds</h3>
            <p>Kathmandu's rivers, characterized by wide, sandy riverbeds and meandering courses, have been significantly altered<sup><a href="https://nepalitimes.com/banner/kathmandus-flash-floods-are-4-decades-in-the-making">(1)</a></sup>. Stone walls now constrain many rivers, squeezing them into narrower channels and reducing their capacity to hold floodwaters<sup><a href="https://nepalitimes.com/banner/kathmandus-flash-floods-are-4-decades-in-the-making">(1)</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Covered and Built Over Streams</h3>
            <p>Many small seasonal streams (kholsi) that once played a role in draining the valley have been covered or built over<sup><a href="https://nepalitimes.com/banner/kathmandus-flash-floods-are-4-decades-in-the-making">(1)</a></sup>.
            This disrupts their natural flow patterns and can lead to unexpected flooding when heavy rain occurs<sup><a href="https://nepalitimes.com/banner/kathmandus-flash-floods-are-4-decades-in-the-making">(1)</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Climate Change</h3>
            <p>Climate change, especially the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events, is likely contributing to Nepal's flood problems<sup><a href="https://risingnepaldaily.com/news/30780">(2)</a><a href="https://www.preventionweb.net/news/rapid-urbanisation-and-climate-change-key-drivers-dramatic-flood-impacts-nepal">(3)</a><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/2/what-caused-the-devastating-floods-in-nepal">(4)</a></sup>.
            However, experts caution against using climate change as a scapegoat for the lack of proper urban planning and river management<sup><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/2/what-caused-the-devastating-floods-in-nepal">(4)</a></sup>.</p>
